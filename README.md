# NFA Simulator

Author: Megan Richardson

This is my final Project for Intro to Theory of Computation (CMSI 385, Fall 2020). I have created a Nondeterministic Finite Automata Simulator in Typescript. The code for the simulator is inside the src folder in NondeterministicFiniteStateMachine.ts and the test code in NondeterministicFiniteStateMachine.spec.ts.
